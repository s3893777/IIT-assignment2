      <p>The IT Professional today is William (Will) Ferguson is a software engineer who created Wylas Timing from a need to make electronic timing systems more user friendly. Wylas Timing is an automatic timing system targeted a swimming competition out of Queensland Australia. Will has been in the IT industry since the 1992 and most recently worked for Boeing [1].</p>
      <p>Will spends the most part of his day working on updates and improvements to the Wylas Timing software. To assist him he has employed a student who is studying software engineer at university [1]. These planned update and improvements will need to be coded and tested. Any errors found will need to be corrected and further testing will be required. Will and this employee can also solve any client problems they may have with the Wylas Timing product. To solve the problem, they will need the client to describe or video the error [1]. The Wylas team will then need replicate the error and then they will need to find a solve for the error. This many take a couple of hours or can try days to solve. According to Will this is the best and the most time-consuming part of the job.</p>
      <p>deas for the timing hardware, such as, a starter (Trinity Starter) and a relay for the touchpad (Beamatouch) need to be created and prototyped before the coding can be done [2]. Will uses an electronic engineer to create all the prototypes for these systems then he will send it out for mass production.</p>
      <p>Wylas Timing has a website, which is maintained by a website design company [1]. Will could have created and maintained the website but has decided to focus on the Wylas Timing software and hardware. Unlike most business this relationship was a “two-way street”. As Will had provide IT support to the website designers.</p>
      <p>Will also spends time communicating with both prospective and current clients. Pre-COVID-19 Will was able to visit clients and demonstrate products in person. The most exciting moment according to Will is when client is surprised how easy everything is to setup and to operate [1].</p>
      <p>Sales and Marketing is a part of all businesses and needed to grow. Will finds this the most challenging part of his business. As a software engineer, he is not a natural salesperson [1]. He prefers people see and try the Wylas Timing software and decide for themselves whether they would purchase his product.</p>

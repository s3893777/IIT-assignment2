      <p>The IT professional today is William "Will" Ferguson is a software engineer who created Wylas Timing from a
        need to make electronic timing systems more user-friendly. Wylas Timing is an automatic timing system targeted at 
        a swimming competition out of Queensland Australia. Will has been in the IT industry since 1992 and most
        recently worked for Boeing (Huynh 2020).</p>
      <p>Will spends most of his day working on updates and improvements to the Wylas Timing software with the assistance
        of a university student software engineer (Huynh 2020). These planned
        updates
        and improvements are coded and tested, and any errors are corrected with required further testing.
        With just a description or video of an error, Will and this 
        employee are able to solve any client problems with the Wylas Timing product (Huynh 2020), and depending on the complexity 
        of the error within a few hours or days, the Wylas team will replicate the error and find a solution. According to Will, 
        this is the best and most time-consuming part of the job.</p>
      <p>Ideas for the timing hardware, such as a starter (Trinity Starter) and a relay for the touchpad (Beamatouch) need to be 
        created and prototyped before the coding can be done (Wylas Timing 2014). Will uses an electronic engineer to create all 
        the prototypes for these systems before sending them out for mass production.</p>
      <p>Wylas Timing has a website, maintained by a website design company (Huynh 2020). Will could have created and maintained 
        the website but has decided to focus on the Wylas Timing software and hardware. Unlike most businesses, this relationship 
        was a “two-way street” as Will had provided the website designers IT support.</p>
      <p>Will also spends time communicating with both prospective and current clients. Pre-COVID-19, Will was able to visit clients 
        and demonstrate products in person. The most exciting moment, according to Will, is when clients were surprised by how easy 
        everything was to set up and operate (Huynh 2020).</p>
      <p>ales and marketing are a part of all businesses and are what encourages growth. Will finds this the most challenging part 
        of his business as a software engineer, he is not a natural salesperson (Huynh 2020). He prefers people to see and try the 
        Wylas Timing software and decide for themselves whether they would purchase his product.</p>

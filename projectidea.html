      <h2>Bake Bot</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Baking can look daunting from the outside. People new to baking can be quite surprised with all the mathematics
        involved. Fractions, multiplication, division, addition. The prep work behind the recipes is quite complicated
        with precise measurements, complex calculations, and mistakes that lead to disaster. For a new baker, baking can
        be quite stressful. Particularly if you are baking for family, friends, or a loved one and you want to impress
        them. One small miscalculation when measuring, in some baking recipes, can mean a big disappointment when it
        comes out of the oven. But with Bake Bot at your side that won’t ever happen again.</p>
      <p>Bake Bot is an app that automates the baking process so you can focus on what really matters — baking. It does
        the math for you. It does the measurements for you. It gives you a step-by-step guide for each recipe with
        timers and helpful tips, so you don’t burn your bread or collapse your cake. It also allows you to organise the
        recipes that matter to you in your baking journal while keeping a history of you past successes. With Bake Bot
        you can have your perfectly baked dish hassle-free. No multiplication, no addition, no fuss. When it comes to
        baking, Bake Bot says Muffins, not math.</p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>A few years ago, I decided to learn how to cook. I wanted to learn every area of cooking, so when it came time
        to learn baking, I was quite intimidated. It looked hard. It looked complicated. And it was. Measurements were
        all over the place, with tablespoons and teaspoons and cups and grams. You had to do math for some reason. And
        the recipes were hard too. One mistake could ruin everything. It was uniquely difficult from any other type of
        cooking I had done up to this point. And the worst part was…all of it was unnecessary. You don’t have to do math
        while cooking. You don’t have to constantly look up how many tablespoons are in a cup. We have apps for that,
        right? Except we don’t, all the cooking apps were for making grocery lists or for diet fads. This is when the
        idea came to me, if no one else was going to do it then I would have to do it myself. And make baking
        hassle-free forever.</p>
      <h3>Market Interest</h3>
      <p>The data is in and it is clear to see that home cooking post-covid is here to stay. Both the IRI (a big data
        company), Tom Youl (the leader of the Australian industry analysis team at Ibisworld), and Hunter (an American
        consumer research firm) all agree that home cooking is on the rise worldwide and not slowing down.</p>
      <p>During the initial covid lockdown in Australia, the IRI reported chilled and abundant categorises in grocery
        stores ‘experienced double-digit growth’ with “the strongest performing categories [showing] clear signs of
        baking from scratch; flours and bread mixes rose by 51 per cent, cake and [sic] muffin mixes by 35 per cent,
        seasonings by 35 per cent and cream by 32 per cent” (IRI 2020) reported in (InsideFMCG 2020 para 5). And
        post-covid, this growth in home baking isn’t going anywhere as IRI reports “Cooking from scratch is expected to
        continue into 2021 with 66 per cent of IRI’s recent shopper panel survey stating that they will continue to
        create meals from scratch more often.” (IRI 2020) reported in (InsideFMCG 2020 para 10) Tom Youl is calling it a
        ‘retail renaissance’, saying “There has been a massive swing for all household expenditure from services to
        retail” (Tom Youl 2020) reported in (The Guardian 2020 para 6) and that “Supermarkets and grocery stores have
        really outperformed takeaway” (Tom Youl 2020) reported in (The Guardian 2020 para 17).</p>
      <p>In America, it is no different with data from Hunter showing that “Americans are continuing to cook more (51%)
        and bake more (41%) than they did at the same time last year” (Hunter 2021, para 5), with “…71% saying they will
        continue to [cook]…after the pandemic ends” (Hunter 2021, para 5).</p>
      <p>The home cooking revival is a worldwide phenomenon and baking is leading the charge. More than ever before
        people post-covid are continuing to cook and bake at home, with more people trying out baking for the first
        time. Every one of these new home bakers is a potential user of Bake Bot and part of our target audience. Never
        before has the market for baking assistants been larger than now in our post-covid world. Countless home bakers
        across the world will be looking to streamline and automate their baking experience to have an easy,
        mistake-free time. Smart baking for smart bakers.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Bake Bot’s main feature, the <i>Dynamic Recipe</i>, will allow users to truly custom and simplify their baking
        recipes to what they want. With it, a baker would be able to customise the quantity of a given recipe to what
        they need. Say you want to make three cakes instead of just one. Bake Bot will do all the math for you so you
        can focus on baking rather than math.</p>
      <p>The <i>Dynamic Recipe</i> also shows the recipe’s ingredients in all measurement types so a baker can pick the
        one to their liking. Never again will you have to quickly lookup how many grams there are in a tbsps or
        millilitres in a cup. It will all be right here in the <i>Dynamic Recipe</i>. And if applicable, with the simple
        press of a button you can convert recipes into vegan alternatives or low-fat options. Scouring the internet for
        vegan cake recipes will be a thing of the past. With Bake Bot’s <i>Dynamic Recipe</i>, all the information
        you’ll ever need is in your hand whenever you need it.</p>
      <p>Bake Bot will have a step-by-step <i>Baking Guide</i> from start to finish. It will give a baker the exact time
        needed to bake a given dish using a countdown alarm, so you never burn your bread. It will also show the precise
        temperature needed for either fan-forced or conventional ovens. And when a baker wants that tasty crust or is
        baking a multi-staged recipe, Bake Bot will show when to change temperatures at right time, every time. And if
        it’s your first time baking a new recipe? No problem. Bake Bot will give you handy tips and tricks so your first
        time making a souffle isn’t a learning experience but a delicious one.</p>
      <p>Ever wanted to bake a specific recipe but forgot its name and can’t for the life of you find it anywhere? Or
        maybe you want to try something new that you have never had before? With Bake Bot’s intuitive <i>Recipe Search</i>, you can. Just enter in some key details like if the recipe is it chocolaty, fruity, or savoury? Or
        maybe what it feels like, is it fluffy, crunchy, or spongy. You can even search for recipes by nationality, like
        Danish for their pastries, French for their rich complex desserts, or Britain for those simple tea cakes. And if
        you want to try new things, you can randomly search for recipes to find those surprise favourites. With Bake
        Bot’s <i>Recipe Search</i>, you’ll find what you want in a flash. </p>
      <p>Bake Bot doesn’t just help you bake, it teachers you too. Bake Bot’s <i>Baking Beginner's Guide</i> provides
        users with a structured ten recipe short course to teach the fundamentals of baking for beginners. From simple
        stuff like baking blueberry muffins and pancakes, to the baking essentials like how to make your own self-rising
        flour or dough. Informative notes in each recipe will help you every step of the way making sure you’re learning
        and on track. Everyone from kids to adults trying out baking for the first time can benefit from this. Make it
        an event and learn baking as a family with Bake Bot.</p>
      <p>Bake Bot will have a <i>Baking Journal</i> where you can save and keep your favourite custom recipes so that
        they’re never lost. The <i>Baking Journal</i> also means you don’t have to go through the hassle of picking a
        specific quantity every time you start the same recipe again. The <i>Baking Journal</i> can also be used to see
        your history of bakes, showing every recipe you baked and how quickly you did them, so you can see how much you
        have improved as a baker from start to finish. With Bake Bot, an entire baking book and more is at your
        fingertips. </p>
      <h3>Monetisation</h3>
      <p>Monetisation is one of the most important components of any application and one young app developers often
        forget. Many young start-ups think that the innovations and raw utility of their apps will carry them to
        success. However, that can’t be further from the truth. You could have the best idea in the world, but if you
        don’t have a way to sell it, it’s not sustainable and if it’s not sustainable, it’s not a good idea.</p>
      <p>Bake Bot along with many other popular utility apps, like Grammarly, will employ a freemium model. This
        monetisation model allows free use of the base app, only allowing access to additional features through the
        premium version. Freemium models are prevalent in the app market as they cast a wide net letting anyone try the
        app for free and become invested enough to pay for the full product later. They also don’t have ads that turn
        off users and are generally unintrusive to the user.</p>
      <p>The free version of Bake Bot will have access to the <i>Dynamic Recipe</i> feature with a limited number of basic
        baking recipes to choose from, as well as the baking assistant, the recipe search, and the <i>Baking Beginner’s
        Guide</i>. The premium version allows users entry into the Baking Journal and hundreds of baking recipes from all
        over the world from China to Turkey to France.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Bake Bot will have a storefront that gives referral links to off-app online stores that have partnered with Bake Bot to provide cooking utensils on special offers. Furthermore, when using the <i>Dynamic Recipe</i>, if you lack a crucial utensil or baking tool needed to complete a recipe Bake Bot will refer you to a multitude of online stores that provide that item. So, you don’t skip a beat when baking. </p>
      <p>Other popular utility-based apps like Honey use a referral monetisation system where users are referred to sales and special offers from off-app stores by Honey and when users go to other apps to buy goods, Honey takes a cut from referring them to the store. Referral systems are becoming a trend among new apps services. As the model is very profitable while also being one of the least intrusive to the user experience and giving further benefit to the user rather than being a hurdle to overcome.</p>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>My idea with Bake Bot is to have it be what I have always wanted when cooking. An easy-to-use and understandable hub of information and assistant in the palm of my hand, so I don’t have to go back and forth from the kitchen to the computer all the time when baking. And with the unprecedented level of new home bakes post-covid I think many others will feel the same. the market for a baking assistant app that streamlines the old messy way of cooking is both large and untapped. Home bakes both new and old across the world will be looking for a way to simplify their baking experience and get rid of the hassle of the past for a newer, smarter future.</p>
      <p>With Bake Bot that future becomes a reality. New bakers can start fresh without intimidation or fear of the more challenging parts of baking. While skilled bakers get a handy gadget that eliminates the tedium and daily annoyances of cooking. Bake Bot appeals to everyone, at every level of baking. From kids wanting to learn baking for the first time to the bakers who have written their own recipe books. Bake Bot is for everybody and it can be for you too.</p>

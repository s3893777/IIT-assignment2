  <h1>Combined Group Results</h1>
  <H2> Contrasting Job Positions </h2>
  <br></br>
  <p> In comparing each ideal job for our 5 team members, its quick and easy to see how important problem solving is and creating thinking. Each roll shares very similar basic steps. 
-	 Annalyse- Weather it’ analyzing the process of the business or the systems used, they all require analyzing a program/system/structure and understanding current systems. 
-	Report – Collate data about what needs to be repaired/improved on or implemented
-	Tech application – Applying tech to solve the problem. 
The main difference is front end and back end, meaning positions like Martina's and Peter's positions we would have more interactions with the clients and communication as to what their goals are. Similarly, for Josh although Josh can be on the back end of the team, meaning working behind the scenes to build systems. Will's position is more behind the scenes resolving issues and generating solutions, where Will looks more at the tech a company uses then the companies goals. Josh Martina & Peter look at the business's needs then looks at how their tech matches their needs. 

Each Position requires, analyst, solutions, problem solving, communication, technical skils to implement the stradegy, critical and creative thinking. All positions require team work and/or communication.

 <h1>Combined Personality Test Results </h1>
  <H2> Personality Chart </h2>

  <h3>How personality tests can help your team dynamic. </h3>
<p>With each team member doing three personality tests, it has offered in depth available information for self and team members reflection. 
We have all leaned crucial information as to our personality traits and also other personalities. 
This information is very useful in a personal growth situation, and even more so in a team environment. This information gives you insight into how you and others handle situations. Some key areas to consider are where one team member may be introverted or extraverted, this will give you insight if you may need to probe for more information from the introvert and maybe reduce the information from the extravert in order to balance out the group dynamic. In this current scenario the extravert would be ideal in presentations or the “front man” of the potential upcoming assignments, where the introvert will not feel as comfortable in this scenario. 
The graph that we created shows how each member sits next to the other. You can clearly see where the team members strengths/weaknesses are. Although they are not weaknesses and everyone will equal out, there are definitely areas where each strength should be applied to the correct task at hand. 

The personality tests gives you the information you need to ascertain how a person approaches tasks, sharing this information gives the group the information on how to apply the person into the task that fits into their strength. 
It also enables us to understand how certain people are voiced differently and how one communicates their opinion on items. 
Although conflict may be inevitable in some scenarios understanding personalities may assist avoiding this. As in the above example two people the same may but heads, where as two opposing personalities may work better together in gaining a full picture. 
With all of the above taken into account, I believe these tests are crucial step in understanding team dynamic and individual behavior.

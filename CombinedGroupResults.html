      <h2> Contrasting Job Positions </h2>

      <p>In comparing each ideal job for our five team members, it's clear to see how important problem solving and creative
        thinking is. Each role shares very similar basic steps, whether it’s analysing the process of a business or analysing
        a program/system/structure and understanding its current systems. Reporting is also a shared factor, such as collating
        data about what needs to be repaired/improved on or what needs to be implemented. Another is tech application, such as
        applying technology to solve a problem. The main difference is the front end and back end, meaning in positions like
        Martina and Peter's, there would be more interactions with the clients and communication about client goals. Josh would
        have a significant amount of client interaction but would also operate on the back end of the team, such as working
        behind the scenes to build systems. Blade's position is more behind the scenes resolving issues and generating solutions,
        whereas Will looks more at the tech a company uses than the companies goals. Josh, Martina and Peter look at the business's
        needs and how their tech matches their needs. Each position requires analyse, solutions, problem-solving, communication,
        technical skills to implement the strategy, and critical and creative thinking. All positions also require teamwork and/or
        communication.</p>

      <h3>How personality tests can help your team dynamic. </h3>
      <p>With each team member doing three personality tests, it has offered an in-depth look at the available information for us to reflect on.
        We have all learned crucial information about our personality traits and behaviours. This information is very useful for personal growth
        and even more so in a team environment. This gave insight into how we handled situations. Some key areas to consider were where one team
        member may be introverted or extroverted, allowing a more informed decision when either requesting more information from an introvert or
        an extrovert allowing others to speak or contribute in order to balance out the group dynamic. In this current scenario, the extrovert
        would be ideal in presentations or the “frontman” of the potential upcoming assignments, whereas the introvert would not feel as comfortable
        in this role. The graph that we created shows how each member sits next to the other. You can clearly see where the team members strengths
        and weaknesses are. Ensuring weaknesses are covered and strengths can be applied to the correct task at hand. The personality tests provide
        the information our group needed to ascertain how a person approached tasks, sharing this information gives the group the information on
        how to apply the person into the task that fits into their strength. It also enables us to understand how certain people are voiced
        differently and how one communicates their opinion on items. Although conflict may be inevitable in some scenarios understanding personalities
        assists in avoiding this. As in the above example, two similar people may butt heads, whereas two opposing personalities may work better
        together in gaining a full picture. With all of the above taken into account, I believe these tests are a crucial step in understanding
        team dynamics and individual behaviour.</p>

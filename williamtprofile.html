            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3905591
                <br><strong>Email: </strong>s3905591@student.rmit.edu.au
            </p>
            <p>Born and raised in Australia, with Vietnamese heritage. I enjoy creating plastic modelling of robots
                (scaled down) in my free time. I find enjoyment in this hobby, maybe due to the fact as a child I found
                robots to be cool and amazing in a way that I can't really explain, that’s partly where my interest
                began from.</p>
            <p>My interest in IT grew from a young age where my family had owned a PC.. I'm still amazed by how IT has
                evolved over the past years and I'm intrigued to see how it will keep growing. The only IT experience I
                have was when I was studying in high school where I had two classes on IT, one class was about software
                and the other was networking.</p>

            <h2>Peronality Test</h2>
             <h3>Individual test outcomes</h3>
<p>William strongly agrees with his results. He agrees “he works better alone then with others.” As he is introverted. He prefers to receive instructions then to give instructions. William enjoys a supportive roll, where he can support others and receive support to overcome issues.  William prefers a hands on to learning, where he can learn by physical touch, and prefers a visual learning environment. William takes a straightforward approach when working with a team, providing constructive criticism and open to receiving it. 
The results of Williams personality test also bring a mirror to his personality and behavior mannerisms. This brings awareness to self-development areas and awareness to how he handles others, and how others may handle him.

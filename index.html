        <p>Born in QLD Australia, I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese, I am interested in world history and events and like to study different cultures. I also have two pet cats, Anchovy and Ravioli.</p>
        <p>I have always had a passive interest in IT from a young age, as I was surrounded by it for as long as I can remember. My mother and father were very early adopters of computers in the ‘80s and even now I can still remember, as a child, my mother using a computer 
  and showing me the amazing things it could do. I have always loved computers and technology and when I was a teenager, I came across a video about programming on YouTube. In the video the programmer gave a quick backstory on himself and how he got into IT. I immediately related to his story and it stimulated my interest. I then began 
  watching video after video on programming. Finding the magic and wonder for something new, and since then I knew my future would be in IT.</p>

        <p>I am Australian-born Chinese I speak mostly English but I can speak Cantonese too!  like adventuring & woodworking. I am problem-solver and a perfectionist. From a young age I had many ambitions of creating websites and databases. Currently working in the Aquatic Industry I found many programs that I feel I could improve on as most programs are archaic and require a face lift. I am passionate about finding solutions.</p>
        <p>Previously I built a raspberry-pi magic mirror noticeboard as I did not want to purchase a Google Nest for my dad. It shows family events, family photo album and other interesting things. Another IT project was building a NAS device from old hardware. The NAS device started as backup and share drive for my family. The other reason I built the NAS is to have local security system.</p>

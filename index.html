        <p>I was born in Australia, I have heritage ties to Greece and Lebanon. I have zero IT knowledge other than
          daily use. I’m a father of 3 beautiful children, I currently run three businesses, I have a lengthy working
          career and life experience. Most of my education has been in Business or Real Estate related. Hobbies, I work
          out and have trained Jiu Jitsu for 6 years now.I first became interested in I.T. Very early in primary school,
          when our IT teacher stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects. Our first project was a
          traffic light system automatically turning on and off traffic lights in a certain order. His passion for IT
          was inspiring and stimulated my passion, I love anything electronic and techy. Since then, I have had a strong
          interest in any tech, whether in business or personal life.</p>

        <p>Born and raised in Australia, with Vietnamese heritage. I enjoy creating plastic modelling of robots (scaled
          down) in my free time. I find enjoyment in this hobby, maybe due to the fact as a child I found robots to be
          cool and amazing in a way that I can't really explain.</p>
        <p>My interest in IT grew from a young age where my family had owned a PC.. I'm still amazed by how IT has
          evolved over the past years and I'm intrigued to see how it will keep growing. The only IT experience I have
          was when I was studying in high school where I had two classes on IT, one class was about software and the
          other was networking.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Born in QLD Australia, I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese, I am interested in world history
          and events and like to study different cultures. I also have two pet cats, Anchovy and Ravioli.</p>
        <p>I have always had a passive interest in IT from a young age, as I was surrounded by it for as long as I can
          remember. My mother and father were very early adopters of computers in the ‘80s and even now I can still
          remember, as a child, my mother using a computer
          and showing me the amazing things it could do. I have always loved computers and technology and when I was a
          teenager, I came across a video about programming on YouTube. In the video the programmer gave a quick
          backstory on himself and how he got into IT. I immediately related to his story and it stimulated my interest.
          I then began
          watching video after video on programming. Finding the magic and wonder for something new, and since then I
          knew my future would be in IT.</p>

        <p>I am Australian-born Chinese I speak mostly English but I can speak Cantonese too! like adventuring &
          woodworking. I am problem-solver and a perfectionist. From a young age I had many ambitions of creating
          websites and databases. Currently working in the Aquatic Industry I found many programs that I feel I could
          improve on as most programs are archaic and require a face lift. I am passionate about finding solutions.</p>
        <p>Previously I built a raspberry-pi magic mirror noticeboard as I did not want to purchase a Google Nest for my
          dad. It shows family events, family photo album and other interesting things. Another IT project was building
          a NAS device from old hardware. The NAS device started as backup and share drive for my family. The other
          reason I built the NAS is to have local security system.</p>

        <p>I was born is Australia and have lived here my whole life. I Just turned 29,
          I enjoy keeping in shape with skiing swimming and dancing. I do not carry any IT experience other than the day
          to day use of IT, I have always felt intrigue towards IT for as long as I can remember. Whether it was through
          video games consoles or even general home appliances, I've been fascinated by what makes them operate and how
          they came to be.</p>

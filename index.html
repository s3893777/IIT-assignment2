        I was born in Australia, I have heritage ties to Greece and Lebanon. I have zero IT knowledge other than daily use. I’m a father of 3 beautiful children, I currently run three businesses, I have a lengthy working career and life experience. Most of my education has been in Business or Real Estate related. Hobbies, I work out and have trained Jiu Jitsu for 6 years now.I first became interested in I.T. Very early in primary school, when our IT teacher stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects. Our first project was a traffic light system automatically turning on and off traffic lights in a certain order. His passion for IT was inspiring and stimulated my passion, I love anything electronic and techy. Since then, I have had a strong interest in any tech, whether in business or personal life.

        Born and raised in Australia, with Vietnamese heritage. I enjoy creating plastic modelling of robots (scaled down) in my free time. I find enjoyment in this hobby, maybe due to the fact as a child I found robots to be cool and amazing in a way that I can't really explain.

        MY interest in IT grew from a young age where my family had owned a PC.. I'm still amazed by how IT has evolved over the past years and I'm intrigued to see how it will keep growing. The only IT experience I have was when I was studying in high school where I had two classes on IT, one class was about software and the other was networking.

        I was born is Australia and have lived here my whole life. I Just turned 29, I enjoy keeping in shape with skiing swimming and dancing. I do not carry any IT experience other than the day to day use of IT, I have always felt intrigue towards IT for as long as I can remember. Whether it was through video games consoles or even general home appliances, I've been fascinated by what makes them operate and how they came to be.

        Born in QLD Australia, I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese, I am very into world history and events and like to study different cultures around the world. Mostly Asian and European. I also have two pet cats. I have always had a passive interest in IT from a young age, as I was surrounded by it for as long as I can remember. My mother and father were very early adopters of computers in the ‘80s and even now I can still remember, as a child, my mother using a computer and showing me cool things it could do. I have always loved computers and technology Through in my developing years. I came across a video about programming and the guy in the video gave a quick backstory on himself and how he got into programming, I immediately related to his story and it stimulated my interest, then I began watching video after video on programming — how to code, the basics of programming. The magic and wonder for something new and fresh and I knew then my future would be in IT

      <p>I am Australian-born Chinese I speak mostly English but I can speak Cantonese too!  like adventuring & woodworking. I am problem-solver and a perfectionist. From a young age I had many ambitions of creating websites and databases. Currently working in the Aquatic Industry I found many programs that I feel I could improve on as most programs are archaic and require a face lift. I am passionate about finding solutions.</p>
      <p>Previously I built a raspberry-pi magic mirror noticeboard as I did not want to purchase a Google Nest for my dad. It shows family events, family photo album and other interesting things. Another IT project was building a NAS device from old hardware. The NAS device started as backup and share drive for my family. The other reason I built the NAS is to have local security system.</p>

  <h2> Github repository trail. </h3>
  <p>In my opinion, our Github Repository trail does not accurately reflect our group's individual work.
    Microsoft Teams is more accurate trail of events and also file uploads. Martina has done the majority
    of the GitHub uploads and adjustments. However, Github would not be an accurate reflection of the team's
    contributions as there is one sole contributor (Martina) with an exception of a couple of small items by others.
     We agreed to all put our documents and comments in one place in Microsoft Teams; that way it was easier to manage.
     We would then we would refine in Github once all items were uploaded. If you wish to look at team contribution,
     Microsoft Teams is the way to go. Github was used more to refine the final work. Although towards the end, you
     will see some individual uploads of components and Blade's proofreading and editing, but will not gain a clear
     picture from Github in our case. You will be able to obtain a better understanding from Microsoft Teams.</p>

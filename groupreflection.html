            <p>At the start of the assignment 2, the group wasn't really connected, even though I wasn't properly communicating with the group (Had trouble using canvas as it was my first time using canvas). After one - three weeks after the assignment had started the group members began to start working together, but I was late to join the Microsoft teams which is where the team connected and did the meetings. As soon as everyone had joined Microsoft teams, communications became better than before. Each team member was assigned a part of A2 to complete, which made things easy for the team to complete tasks. I would like to thank Martina for starting up the Microsoft team without her the group would have formed at a later date and that would have affected all us. Blade and Peter have contributed a lot into the Microsoft team chat and usually take 1 - 2 days to reply to questions. Joshua and I were late to join the Microsoft team but we are attending meetings. Currently the workflow of the group seems good and we had set an early due date for us to give everything in, so that will give the assignment in time.</p>

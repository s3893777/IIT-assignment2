                <p>At the start of the assignment 2, the group wasn't really connected, even though I wasn't properly
                    communicating with the group (Had trouble using canvas as it was my first time using canvas). After
                    one - three weeks after the assignment had started the group members began to start working
                    together, but I was late to join the Microsoft teams which is where the team connected and did the
                    meetings. As soon as everyone had joined Microsoft teams, communications became better than before.
                    Each team member was assigned a part of A2 to complete, which made things easy for the team to
                    complete tasks. I would like to thank Martina for starting up the Microsoft team without her the
                    group would have formed at a later date and that would have affected all us. Blade and Peter have
                    contributed a lot into the Microsoft team chat and usually take 1 - 2 days to reply to questions.
                    Joshua and I were late to join the Microsoft team but we are attending meetings. Currently the
                    workflow of the group seems good and we had set an early due date for us to give everything in, so
                    that will give the assignment in time.</p>

                <p>As the assignment 2 was announced we had to self-organise ourselves into team. Our team had a shaky
                    start. We had a couple of missed opportunities to start communicating with each other. Once the
                    Microsoft Team was created and we had our first meeting we started to get back on track. We still
                    had a couple of missing team members, William, Josh and Alex. When the missing team members (William
                    and Josh) were forget we were able to distribute the workload.</p>
                <p>By week 4 of this study period, we started communicating better. As the deadline grew closer, we
                    started to use MS Team more and more. Hopefully, we can continue this trajectory for the rest of the
                    study period. Communication still needs improving as we are still missing messages</p>

            <h3> Team contribution </h3>
            <p><p>Overall our group has come a long way and we are all pleased to be in our group. 
We all get a long well and have open communication with each other. Our team has
a good mix of personalities All with minimum IT experience although we are enthusiastic 
and determined to work together combine our efforts. 
  </p>
<p>In the beginning we were all concerned with the communication, whether it was concerns 
of missing Team members, or being the missing team member working out how to get into
contact with the team. In the big picture we all just wanted to connect and start 
communications and contributions.  
</p>
<p>Our weekly meetings went really well, we openly discussed ideas, structures.  
and questions. The weekly meetings were very informative and were the roots
of our structure.  We all found comfort and understanding in the weekly meetings 
as we felt comfortable bringing up a topic and have general discussions about a2. 

<p>As we all come from different industries and have different 
commitments, we believe we should have discussed our standard routines, so 
we knew who to contact & when should we have had questions.  We should of 
all stated days and times we will roughly be online, that would of allowed a more 
refined support network, with less times waiting on replies. </p>
<p> Each team member had a different experience within the group and personally 
learned different aspects. One thing we all learned together is how important the 
initial communication is. Its important to get through the initial steps of understanding
how we will communicate to each other and even the rough guidelines on future meetings. 
once that initial introduction hurdle is overcome the communication evolves a lot faster and
every team member feels more comfortable opening up and discussing topics.  The more 
meetings and discussions we can have, the more everyone feels comfortable with the team
members, and opening the door to conversations they may not necessarily open without the 
strong team environment and communication.  Although we are still somewhat hesitant 
shinning the light on our potential flaws, understanding our team members openness and willingness
to help is beneficial. This only comes with time and as we all work and grow together we are able to 
each shine a brighter light on our own learning insecurities and work through them as a team. 

The A Team have overcome hurdles such social anxieties, learning insecurities and confusions. We 
All contributed greatly and were open to discussions. Overall we are happy to be in a team together.

                <h3>Peter Kassis</h3>
                <p>I am personally incredibly pleased with our group, i am grateful to be apart of the A Team. I believe everyone has generally been efficient at communication and all have a strong drive to do their contribution to the best of their ability. We are not a team of great experience although determination and motivation is strong. 
I believe our vibe is one of our strengths, we seem to be open and polite about how we handled assessment two, everyone was quick to put their hand up and happy to help each other. I don’t believe anyone’s toes were stepped on or upset. I also believe everyone contributed as best as they can with their capabilities.  Communication was a little rocky at the start with everyone getting up to spec with the meetings and getting to know each other,  as of today everyone communicates very well, weather chat or in meetings. 
I feel there is a lot of independence in our group, although we chose to allocate set tasks to each individual, I do feel we could improve on other team members contributions, possibly a group run through of each team members work. Allowing opportunity for feedback and amendments.  
I was surprised at how long it took for our groups dust to settle into a rhythm. I thought it would be easy to jump into the group running and get going with work, although as mentioned we had a few bumps on the road in the beginning. 

Its obvious that groups are different in every scenario, although in this study environment I made some self-awareness additions and learned some beneficial things about myself.

                <h3>William Truong</h3>
                <p>At the start of the assignment 2, the group wasn't really connected, even though I wasn't properly
                    communicating with the group (Had trouble using canvas as it was my first time using canvas). After
                    one - three weeks after the assignment had started the group members began to start working
                    together, but I was late to join the Microsoft teams which is where the team connected and did the
                    meetings. As soon as everyone had joined Microsoft teams, communications became better than before.
                    Each team member was assigned a part of A2 to complete, which made things easy for the team to
                    complete tasks. I would like to thank Martina for starting up the Microsoft team without her the
                    group would have formed at a later date and that would have affected all us. Blade and Peter have
                    contributed a lot into the Microsoft team chat and usually take 1 - 2 days to reply to questions.
                    Joshua and I were late to join the Microsoft team but we are attending meetings. Currently the
                    workflow of the group seems good and we had set an early due date for us to give everything in, so
                    that will give the assignment in time. I was personally surprised about how friendly each team member 
					was, i learned how crucial communication is in a team environment. </p>

                <h3>Martina Huynh</h3>
                <p>As the assignment 2 was announced we had to self-organise ourselves into a team. Although we jumped into our 
Canvas group early Our team had a shaky start. We had a couple of missed opportunities to start 
communicating with each other. Once the Microsoft Team was created and we had our first meeting 
we started to get back on track. We still had a couple of missing team members, William, Josh and Alex.
 When the missing team members (William and Josh) were found we were able to distribute the workload.</p>
<p>By week 4 of this study period, we started communicating better. As the deadline grew closer, we
started to use MS Team more and more. Hopefully, we can continue this trajectory for the rest of the
study period. Communication still needs improving as we are still missing messages</p>
I was surprised how little experience we all had in the world of IT, although the team have passion for 
IT, none of our team members had real IT experience.  I quickly realised when you start a team how important the 
Initial contact is and how its important to get everyone on board and contributing asap.

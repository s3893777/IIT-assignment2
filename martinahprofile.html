            <p>I am Australian-born Chinese I speak mostly English but I can speak Cantonese too! I like adventuring
                & woodworking. I am problem-solver and a perfectionist. From a young age I had many ambitions of
                creating websites and databases. Currently working in the Aquatic Industry I found many programs
                that I feel I could improve on as most programs are archaic and require a face lift. I am passionate
                about finding solutions. </p>
            <p>Previously I built a raspberry-pi magic mirror noticeboard as I did not want to purchase a Google Nest
                for my dad. It shows family events, family photo album and other interesting things. Another IT project
                was building a NAS device from old hardware. The NAS device started as backup and share drive for my
                family. The other reason I built the NAS is to have local security system. Martina's Interest in IT
                started at a young age with ambitions of creating websites and databases. Currently Martina finds
                interest in finding and providing solutions on current software she uses. </p>

            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3893777

            </p>
            <p>I am Australian-born Chinese; I speak mostly English, but I can speak Cantonese too! I like adventuring and woodworking.
               I am a problem-solver and a perfectionist. From a young age, I had many ambitions of creating websites and databases. I
               currently work in the Aquatic Industry and have found many programs that I feel I could improve on as most programs are
               archaic and require a facelift. I am passionate about finding solutions. Previously, I built a raspberry-pi magic mirror
               noticeboard as I did not want to purchase a Google Nest for my dad. It shows family events, family photo albums, and other
               interesting things. Another IT project was building a NAS device from old hardware. The NAS device started as a backup and
               share drive for my family. The other reason I built the NAS is to have a local security system.</p>

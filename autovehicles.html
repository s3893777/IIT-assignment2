    <h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
    <div class="main-content-section">
    <p>Autonomous vehicles have been a dream of the future much like robots and personal jet packs. But,
     unlike the latter, autonomous vehicles are closer to being real than ever before. Large car
     manufacturers like Tesla, Toyota, and Ford have invested heavily into self-driving cars who, along with
     a multitude of tech start-ups like Google’s Waymo and Pony.ai, are on the cutting edge of innovation.
     However, the dream of a fully autonomous roadway is still far away with many unsuspecting setbacks
     and controversies haunting the industry.</p>
    <p>Like most new technologies, autonomous vehicles are under a microscope. The fear of uncontrollable
      AI killer cars running over pedestrians is rife in the public’s mind and that fear was heightened after an
      Uber self-driving car killed a woman in Arizona. Foreshadowing Uber’s eventual cancellation of the
      billion-dollar project. Autonomous vehicles have never been less popular than now. The constant
      headlines of automotive hacking incidents and job loss due to self-driving cars have dwarfed the once
      popular idea of a safe, zero-car crash future.</p>
     </div>

      <div class="main-content-section">
      <p>But first — what exactly are autonomous vehicles? Autonomous cars have been around for a long time,
        starting in the late 90s with Mercedes-Benz’s cruise control. Now instead of simple camera sensors and
        lane control we have machine learning and high-tech radar and Linder sensors. Most people today
        think we already have fully autonomous cars; however, currently, autonomous driving is at level 3 of out
        of 5, with level 5 autonomous driving being predicted to be more than a decade away. Understanding
        the levels of autonomous driving is important to both comprehend where we are now and where we’re
        heading. There are five generally accepted levels of autonomous driving that were established by the
        SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) that relate to the extent of human involvement in driving a
        vehicle ranging from driver assistance to full automation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Level 1 autonomy is a driver assistant mode where one system of the driving process is automated in
          isolation with data from onboard cameras and sensors. Either assisting in steering or acceleration but
          not both. A human driver is in charge of making all decisions on the road and operating the vehicle.
          Level 1 autonomous driving can be best seen in the aforementioned Mercedes-Benz’s radar-managed
          cruise control and Honda’s 2008 lane keep assist.</li>
        <li>Level 2 Level 2 autonomy is partial automation. The car can now assist in both steering and acceleration.
          However, a human driver still needs to be alert and monitor the environment and react if the system fails.
          Level 2 autonomy was a massive leap form level one even though the upgrade seems so simple. This is where
          autonomous vehicles truly came into their own in the automotive industry as an unique car separate from
          conventional ones, going from assisting the driver to driving themselves.</ii>
        <li>Level 3 autonomy is conditional automation and where we are now. The car can see its environment
          through autonomous vehicle sensors and can react autonomously to changes in it. The car also
          oversees all systems including safety and brakes. A human driver no longer needs to be alert but still
          needs to be prepared to intervene if a system fails. It is considered conditional as it can’t be
          autonomous at all times in all places, requiring pre-mapped areas through a mixture of machine
          learning and satellite navigation. Level 3 autonomous driving is expected to be used in logistical
          trucking and taxi services in the near future and went commercial in 2020 with the mode available in
          certain highways and metropolitan zones.</li>
        <li>Level 4 autonomy is high automation, with the car being fully autonomous, requiring no driver for
          the entire journey. The car is in control of all systems and makes all decisions but, only in controlled,
          geofenced metropolitan areas. Think of it like autonomous driving on rails. With machine learning, car-
          to-car communication, and HD mapping these cars can perform all tasks a human driver could.
          However. with the geo-limitations of level 4 autonomous driving, it is expected to be predominantly used
          for taxi services and tour buses in dense metropolitan areas. Though multiple car makers are planning
          to sell level 4 self-driving cars by 2022.</li>
        <li>Level 5 autonomy is level 4 without restrictions. These cars leave the operational design domains of the
          level 4 autonomous vehicles and can go anywhere. Not needing dedicated lane markings, a steering
          wheel, pedals, or a human driver. Just set your destination and sit back and relax. With level 5, self
          -driving cars come out of the meticulously managed cities and onto the open road.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="main-content-section">
        <p>Behind all the sensational headlines, a future of an autonomous roadway is a bright one. “Road traffic
          injuries are the leading cause of death among young people aged 5-29.” (ASIRT, Annual Global Road Crash Statistics)
          and the majority of all car crash fatalities worldwide per year “Approximately 1.35 million people” (ASIRT, Annual
          Global Road Crash Statistics) are the result of preventable human error. These preventable crushes also leave “an
          additional 20-50 million [people to] suffer non-fatal injuries, often resulting in long-term disabilities” (ASIRT,
          Annual Global Road Crash Statistics). Autonomous vehicles could bring these numbers close to zero, saving untold
          millions around the world. An autonomous future would also revolutionise both public and private transportation,
          allowing the elderly and disabled, even children to use cars for travel. Roads would be safer than ever before,
          and traffic jams would become a footnote in history.</p>
          <p>However, this future does come with some drawbacks. If all cars, trucks, and buses drove themselves, those who
            drive for a living would be out of work. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2021), in 2018 more than
            1.8 million people were employed as tractor-trailer truck drivers, 370,400 people were employed as taxi and delivery
            drivers, 680,000 were employed as bus drivers, and 915,310 were working as light truck drivers. That comes to a total
            of 3.7 million jobs that would be lost in just the U.S alone if autonomous vehicles become the norm. Proponents of
            autonomous vehicles argue that the switch between self-driving vehicles and human-driven ones is not immediate and
            that new jobs created by autonomous vehicles will match or even surpass the driving job market. However, they fail
            to realise the new jobs created by autonomous vehicles would not be filled by the same people that lost their jobs.
            Driving for a living is an entry-level job that is predominantly employed with high school level education or below.
            It is highly unrealistic to assume that a low-income earner, high school educated, and trucker driver with 20 years’
            experience could just go to university and up-skill to a mechanic, IT, or engineering job. It may be a hard pill
            to swallow but autonomous vehicles will irreversibly hurt the lowest members of society while mostly benefiting
            the well-off who will never see the damage their self-driving cars cause.</p>
            <p>If the automotive industry ever wants to repair the reputation of autonomous vehicles and get the public on board,
               they need to truly examine the leading problems of self-driving cars and look to comprehensively solve them rather
               than ignore them. And if the automotive industry fails to address these issues, then regulatory bodies will address
               them instead.</p>

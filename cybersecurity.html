  <h1>Cyber Security</h1>

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>To start, the definition of Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed
        to protect networks, computers, programs, data from attacks, and damage. This practice is used by individuals
        and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access or misuse of authorized assets from people known as hackers.
        The main goal of a cyberattack is to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extorting money from users,
        or interrupting business. Cybersecurity could also be referred to as electronic information security or information
        technology security. The start of the digitalisation era has opened up a lot of opportunities for everyone, especially
        businesses and enterprises, to connect to obtain digital assets from the internet, but these come with a higher risk
        of security vulnerabilities for their sensitive and confidential data. Counteracting risks, securing your data, and
        combating unknown threats is called cybersecurity. The goal of cybersecurity is to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks
        and protect individuals and organizations from intentional and unintentional exploitation of security weakness in
        networks, security, and technologies.</p>
      <p>Cyber security can be divided into few common categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Network Security: An activity designed to protect users and underlying networking infrastructure from
          unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destructions, malfunctions, or improper disclosures of network or data.</li>
        <li>Application Security: Described as security measures at the application level that aim to prevent code
          within the app or data from being stolen or hijacked.</li>
        <li>Information Security: Also referred to as InfoSec, which is the process of protecting information by
          mitigating information risks both in storage and in transit.</li>
        <li>Operational Security (OPSEC): Process of identifying “critical information” and analyzing how
          adversaries might learn about this “critical information.”</li>
        <li>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR): Can be interchangeable terms even though they are both
          different things. A practice that allows organizations to keep their business running in the event of a
          crisis and return to full functionality when the crisis ends.</li>
        <li>End-User Education: Teaching users or workers at an organisation to delete or report anything suspicious
          such as emails, USB drives, and programs/software. Also, doing various other important lessons vital for
          the security of any organisation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As technology grows and advances, cyber threats do too. The three main types of cyber threats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyber Crime: Also called computer crime, is a crime that involves a computer and a network as an instrument
          to further illegal ends, for financial gains or to cause disruptions</li>
        <li>Cyber Attack: A cyber-attack is an assault done by cybercriminals using one or more computers against a
          single or multiple computers or network, with the intention to attack by maliciously disabling computers,
          stealing data, or using a breached computer as a launching point for other attacks</li>
        <li>Cyber Terrorism: is intended to sabotage electronic systems to cause panic or fear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cybersecurity also stops malware from invading users' computers. Malware means malicious software.
        Some commonly know malware:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Virus</li>
        <li>Trojan</li>
        <li>Spyware</li>
        <li>Adware</li>
        <li>Botnets</li>
        <li>Ransomware</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Currently, the pinnacle of this technology is that it grows based on attacks. However, as hackers find new ways
        to hack a system, others find ways to improve on those weak spots which hackers exploit. The things that can be
        done now are to find alternative ways to improve. An example is that some companies hire a professional hacker
        to have them hack their systems to see and understand what areas that they have to improve.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>What is the likely impact</h2>
      <p>Cybersecurity is really important in today's society, more than ever, as technology grows; if not, more cyber
        threats will occur. A positive impact that cybersecurity has on us is making the internet a more secured area
        by protecting our sensitive data, personally identifiable information, personal information, health information,
        intellectual property, data, and governmental and industry information systems from theft and damage attempted
        by criminals and adversaries. The impact of a cybersecurity failing to do a task can cause major damage to an
        individual and business. From a business point of view, it affects their standings and consumers trust. The
        impact of a security breach could be broken down into three categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Economic cost of cyber attack</li>
        <li>Reputational damage</li>
        <li>Legal consequences of cyber breach</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Similar to the police, cybersecurity is important to sustaining the security and structure of a society
        (although an online one). Everyone wants to see cybersecurity improve, but that is not an easy thing to achieve.
       Because nothing can start perfectly. As everyone is moving towards the digital age where nearly everything is becoming digital,
       everyone will be affected by this technology called cybersecurity. This will create more new jobs for the corporate sector as
       cybersecurity would play a huge role in keeping companies safe from de-registration because of cyber threats. Even hackers could
       find jobs because it's a skill that some businesses look for to determine how strong their protection is against other hackers.
       Here are some jobs that involve cybersecurity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security Analyst</li>
        <li>Security Architect</li>
        <li>Security Software Developer</li>
        <li>Security Engineer</li>
        <li>Security Administrator</li>
        <li>Security Consultant</li>
        <li>Cryptographer</li>
        <li>Cryptanalyst</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <p>Technology is becoming more and more important and integrated into our lives, even as humans have become more dependent on it.
        Nowadays, nearly everyone, at least, has a smartphone or some other type of smart devices whenever and wherever they go. Some
        people can't live a day without using their smartphone because it's just that important to them. I myself can't part ways with
        my phone; I also wear a smartwatch with me. Technology makes life easier, but it also leaves us vulnerable to risks. That is
        why cybersecurity is a top priority and affects our lives greatly. Without it, there would be no way to use the internet
        without risking secure and private information and causing chaos around the world. As I have mentioned before, without cybersecurity,
        it's like having no authority or protection in today's society; chaos would occur and undermine society.</p>
      <p>Cyber threats are a huge deal in today's society and are still occurring. These threats aren't just not stopping but are
        also growing more serious, as anyone could be affected by cyber threats. You wouldn't want your confidential personal
        information stolen without you knowing. As someone who uses the internet daily for shopping, listening to music,
        watching movies, talking to friends, and playing games, this affects me greatly. Knowing that my data is secure gives me,
        peace of mind when interacting with the internet, as well as loved ones. That is why maintaining regular awareness when doing
        anything online is very important, because it can lead to scams or even something more dangerous.</p>

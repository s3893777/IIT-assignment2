  <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
  <div class="main-content">
    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>To start off the definition of Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to
        protect networks, computers, programs, data from attacks, damage. This practice is used by individuals and
        enterprises to protect against unauthorized access or misuse of authorized assets from people called as hackers.
        The main goal of a cyberattack is to access, change or destroy sensitive information; extorting money from
        users; or interrupting business. Cyber security could also be referred to as electronic information security or
        information technology security.</p>
      <p>Since the start of the digitalisation era has opened up a lot of opportunities for everyone, especially
        businesses and enterprises to connect to obtain digital assets from the internet, but these come with a higher
        risk of security vulnerabilities for their sensitive and confidential data. To counteract the risks and to
        secure your data and combating the unknown threats is called cybersecurity. The goal of cyber security is to
        reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and protect individuals and organizations from intentional and unintentional
        exploitation of security weakness in networks, security and technologies.</p>
      <p>Cyber security can be divided into few common categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Network Security: An activity designed to protect users from underlying networking infrastructure from
          unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destructions, malfunctions or improper disclosures of network or
          data</li>
        <li>Application Security: Describes as a security measures at the application level that aim to prevent code
          within the app or data from being stolen or hijacked</li>
        <li>Information Security: Could also be offendedly referred to as InfoSec, which is the process of protecting
          information by mitigating information risks both in storage and in transit</li>
        <li>Operational Security (OPSEC): Process of identifying “critical information”, and analyzing how adversaries
          might learn about this “critical information”</li>
        <li>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR): Can be interchangeable as terms even though they are both
          different things. A practice that allows organizations to keep their business running in the event of a crisis
          and return to full functionality when the crisis ends</li>
        <li>End User Education: Teaching users or workers at an organization to delete or report anything suspicious
          such as emails, USB drives and programs/software. Also, doing various other important lessons is vital for the
          security of any organization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the technology grows and advances, cyber threats do too. The three main types of cyber threats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyber Crime: also called computer crime, is a crime that involves a computer and a network as an instrument
          to further illegal ends, for financial gains or to cause disruptions</li>
        <li>Cyber Attack: A cyber-attack is an assault done by cyber criminals using one or more computers against a
          single or multiple computers or network, with the intention to attack by maliciously disable computers, steal
          data, or use a breached computer as a launching point for other attacks</li>
        <li>Cyber Terrorism: is intended to sabotage electronic systems to cause panic or fear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cybersecurity also stops malware from invading users' computers. Malware means malicious software. Some
        commonly know malware:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Virus</li>
        <li>Trojan</li>
        <li>Spyware</li>
        <li>Adware</li>
        <li>Botnets</li>
        <li>Ransomware</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Currently the state of the art of this technology is that it grows based on attacks. As hackers find new ways
        to hack a system, others find ways to improve on those weak spots where hackers exploit. The things that can be
        done now are to find more alternative ways to improve. An example is that some companies hire a professional
        hacker to have them hack their systems to see and understand what areas that they have to improve.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>What is the likely impact</h2>
      <p>Cyber security is really important in today's society, especially more than ever as technology grows cyber
        security should as well because if not more cyber threats will occur. A positive impact that cyber security has
        to us is made using the internet a more secured area, by protecting our sensitive data, personally identifiable
        information, personal information, health information, intellectual property, data, governmental and industry
        information systems from theft and damage attempted by criminals and adversaries.
        The impact of a cyber security failing to do a task can cause major damage to an individual and business. In a
        business point of view it affects their standings and consumers trust. The impact of a security breach could be
        broken down into three categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Economic cost of cyber attack</li>
        <li>Reputational damage</li>
        <li>Legal consequences of cyber breach</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It comes to show that cyber security is important, like how police are needed to keep society from fighting
        each other. Everyone would want to see cyber security improve, but that is not an easy thing to achieve because
        nothing can start out to be perfect. As everyone is moving towards the digital age where nearly everything is
        becoming digital, everyone will be affected by this technology called cyber security. This will create more new
        jobs for any company because cyber security plays a huge role to keep the company from de-registration because
        of cyber threats. Even hackers could find jobs because it's a skill that some businesses look for, to determine
        how strong their protection is against other hackers. Here are some jobs that involve cyber security:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security Analyst</li>
        <li>Security Architect</li>
        <li>Security Software Developer</li>
        <li>Security Engineer</li>
        <li>Security Administrator</li>
        <li>Security Consultant</li>
        <li>Cryptographer</li>
        <li>Cryptanalyst</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <p>Technology is becoming more and more important and integrated into our lives and humans have become more
        dependent on it. Nowadays nearly everyone at least has a smartphone or some type of smart devices on them
        whenever and wherever, some people can't live without using their smartphone for one day because it's just that
        important to them. I myself can't part ways with my phone a day, I also wear a smartwatch with me. Technology
        makes life easier, but it also leaves us vulnerable to risks. That is why cyber security is so important and is
        a top priority and affects our lives greatly. Without it there would be no way to use the internet as it will
        cause chaos around the world. As i have mentioned before without cyber security is like having no authority
        around in today's society, chaos will occur and that will affect anyone.</p>
      <p>Cyber threats are a huge deal in today's society and are still occurring and the threat isn't just stopping but
        it's also growing more serious, as anyone could be affected by cyber threats. You wouldn't want your
        confidential personal information to be given out without you knowing. As someone who uses the internet on a
        daily basis for shopping, listening to music, watching movies and talking to friends and playing games, this
        affects me greatly. Knowing that my data is secured can give me a piece of mind when interacting with the
        internet, this also applies to family and friends. That is why maintaining regular awareness when doing anything
        online is very important, because it can lead to scams or even something more dangerous.</p>

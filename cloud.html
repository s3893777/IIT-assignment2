  <h1>Cloud, Services and Servers</h1>
  <div class="main-content">

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>The cloud is a server that is an accessible service when using the internet, as well as software and databases
        that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centres, which are all over the world. These centres
        are online all day long; as long as a user has a stable internet connection, the cloud is accessible whenever and
        wherever you are. Cloud computing can be used for both personal and business use. The cloud provides many different
        types of services; some popular examples are Google Drive, Google Stadia, Microsoft Azure, One Drive, VMWare,
        Amazon Web Services, Idrive, Mega, Box, Dropbox and many more. Currently, the state of this new technology is quite viable,
        internet connection being one factor in service. Having a better, stable internet connection would improve the way you
        use the cloud; an example could be better download and upload speeds allowing faster and less time-consuming work.
        Another example would the implementation of 5G internet in Australia, allowing faster speeds when working on the go.</p>
      <p>An easier way to explain what the cloud does is using an example of cloud storage. If you wanted to store data onto
        some type of storage, there are two methods of how you could go with this. Method one is storing data on data storage
        devices (flash memory devices, external or internal HDD/SSD, etc.), meaning that you have a physical copy of your data
        that you stored away. The second method is to store it on the cloud through a cloud storage provider where it could be
        accessed using the internet, granting you a digital copy of your data saved online. Both methods store your data, but some
        factors that you should keep in mind when using either of the methods is scalability: server storage, data security,
        data loss, maintenance, ease of use, and reliability.</p>
      <p>Information technology services could be defined as “The implementation and management of quality IT services that
        meet the needs of the business or users.” IT services provide anything related to making the user/company have an
        effective and efficient way of using IT. Some examples of IT services are cloud backup services, VoIP (Voice Over
        Internet Protocol), monitoring services, cybersecurity services, remote support, SaaS (Software as a Service),
        hardware and software, network infrastructure, etc.</p>
      <p>A server is a computer (software or hardware) that provides information to other computers; these computers are called
        clients. Clients can send requests over the network to the server, and the server can relay back to the client whatever
        is requested usually resources, data, services, or programs. There are many server types some popular examples are a web
        server, virtual server, game server, and database server. Servers are usually used in business. A cloud server is a virtual
        server that can be accessed via the internet instead of needing to use WAN or WLAN.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <p>The impact that the cloud, services, and servers have made from a business standpoint is that it has universally
        improved businesses from big to small. Many businesses made the change to using the cloud over physical hardware
        because it saved the business time and money by boosting productivity, promoting innovation, and improving collaboration.</p>
      <p>Some impacts/benefits from making the change are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lowering computer costs and improving performance: A high spec computer isn't required to run the cloud-based
          application. Applications can be run through the cloud instead of the computer, meaning that the computer
          wouldn't need the processing power or hardware disk space demanded.</li>
          <li>Reduce Software costs: Cloud computing applications are generally free or provided with the cloud services.
            An example is Google docs, sheets, slides and forms.</li>
        <li>Increased Data Liability: In cases when physical servers or data storage devices break down, crash, or
          suffer natural disasters, data will be lost and will be hard to re-obtain data. But the cloud will not
          be affected by any of these factors because a typical cloud service</li>
        <li>Scalability: With the cloud, it is very simple to go up or down on the required storage amount, making
          it very flexible, and with this, allows a business to save more on buying physical storages. You would
          only pay the cloud provider for your specific difference from regular usage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More businesses will make the change to the cloud, and in the end, it could affect those with jobs dealing with
        servers redundant due to the cloud provider maintaining the server rather than an individual.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <p>I talked a lot about how the cloud affected business and enterprises but didn't talk much about how it affects IT
        personally. Previously, I talked about how the cloud could affect some IT jobs and could potentially replace them
        due to redundancy and expense. Not all businesses will make the switch because the cloud is not a completely
        impeccable technology yet, and also, some businesses that can maintain both will do so as it is more secure.
        But in the end, this technology will end up creating more jobs, and as a student inspired to look for work in a
        server environment, I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloud will be involved. The cloud is being used so
        universally that some applications, software, or games that I myself may be using utilise the cloud or its servers
        in some way, and I don’t even realise. This shows that the cloud is being used more frequently. The cloud, services,
        and servers are a prominent technology now; it's being used in many popular companies some examples are Spotify which
        uses google cloud to stream music to its users. Another popular example is Netflix which uses Amazon's Web Services
        to stream movies to users. Both these examples are extremely popular and can be used on many smart devices such as
        smart TV, smart speakers, smartphones, smartwatch, tablets, and PCs etc. I believe that it has affected many people,
        including me, about how everyone interacts with the internet when using their smart devices or computer.</p>

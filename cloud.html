  <h1>Cloud, Services and Servers</h1>
  <div class="main-content">
    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>The cloud is a server that is an accessible service using the internet, and the software and databases that run
        on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers which all over the world and are online all day long
        meaning whenever and wherever you are in the world you can access the servers unless you do not have a stable
        connection to the internet you won't be able to access it. Cloud computing could be used for both personal and
        business. The cloud provides many different types of services, some popular examples of services that use the
        cloud are Google Drive, Google Stadia, Microsoft Azure, One Drive, VMWare, Amazon Web Services, Idrive, Mega,
        Box, Dropbox and many more. Currently the state of this new technology the cloud is in a pretty good spot,
        because as long as you have a stable connection to the cloud provider you can connect to it anywhere but having
        a better internet connection (better download and upload speeds) will improve the way you use the cloud, an
        example of why having better internet could benefit the cloud would be download and upload speed from the cloud
        will be faster and less time consuming. Sooner in Australia to efficiently use the cloud I believe that with 5G
        internet coming soon will help Australians benefit from the cloud more than our current state.</p>
      <p>An easier way to explain what the cloud does is using an example of cloud storage. If you wanted to store data
        onto some type of storage there are two methods of how you could go with this, method one is to store it on a
        data storage devices (Flash memory devices, External or Internal HDD/SSD etc) meaning that you have a physical
        copy of your data that you stored away or the second method is to store it on the cloud thought a cloud storage
        provider where it could be accessed using the internet whenever and wherever meaning that you have digital copy
        of your data saved online. Both methods had done the job of storing your data but some factors that you should
        keep in mind when using either of the methods are the Scalability, Server Storage, Data Security, Data Loss,
        Maintenance, Ease of Use and Reliability.</p>
      <p>Information Technology services could be defined as “The implementation and management of quality IT services
        that meets the needs of the business or users”. IT services provide for anything that is related to IT to make
        the user/company have an effective and efficient way of using IT. Some examples of IT services are Cloud Backup
        Services, VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol), Monitoring Services, Cybersecurity Services, Remote Support, SaaS
        (Software as a Service), Hardware & Software, Network Infrastructure, etc.</p>
      <p>A server is a computer (software or hardware) that provides information to other computers, these computers are
        called clients. Clients are able to send requests over the network to the server, and the server is able to
        relay back to the client whatever is requested, usually resources, data, services or programs. There are many
        server types; some popular examples are web server, virtual server, game server and database server. Servers are
        usually used in business. A cloud server is a virtual server that can be accessed via the internet instead of
        needing to use WAN or WLAN.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <p>The impact that the cloud, services and servers have made on a business's stand point is that it has improved
        businesses from ranges too small to big, many businesses made the change to be using the cloud over physical
        hardware because it can save the business time and money by boosting productivity, promoting innovation and
        improving collaboration.</p>
      <p>Some impacts/benefits from making the change are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lowering computer costs and improve performance: A high spec computer isn't required to run the cloud based
          application. Applications can be run through the cloud instead of the computer meaning that the computer
          wouldn't need the processing power or hardware disk space demanded.</li>
        <li>Reduce Software costs: Cloud computing applications are generally free or provided with the cloud services.
          An example is Google docs, sheets, slides and forms.</li>
        <li>Increased Data Liability: In cases when physical servers or data storage devices break down, crash or by
          natural disasters data will be lost and it will be hard to re-obtain that data. But the cloud will not be
          affected by any of these because a typical cloud service provides multiple backups in each data center around
          the world.</li>
        <li>Scalability: With the cloud it is very simple to go up or down on required storage amount making it very
          flexible and with this you could save more money than buying physical storages. You will only pay the cloud
          provider for your specific difference from regular usage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More business will make the change to the cloud, and in the end it could affect those with jobs dealing with
        servers cause its making it redundant to maintain servers whereas you can have the cloud provider maintain the
        server for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <p>I talked a lot about how the cloud affected business and enterprises but didn't talk much about how it affects
        it personally. Previously I talked about how the cloud could affect some IT jobs and could potentially replace
        them because it's redundant to have both and the company will have to spend extra money to maintain the cloud
        and IT workers. Not all businesses will make the switch because the cloud is not a completely impeccable
        technology yet, and also some businesses that can maintain both will have both because it's more secure that
        way. In the end this technology will end up creating more jobs, and as a student inspired to look for work in a
        server environment is looking forward to seeing how the cloud will be involved. The cloud is being used so often
        that some applications, software or games that I myself may be using the cloud or servers in some way and don’t
        even know about it. That comes to show that the cloud is being used more frequently. The cloud, services and
        servers is a prominent technology now, it's being used in many popular companies some examples are Spotify which
        uses google cloud to stream music to the users and another popular example is Netflix which uses Amazon's Web
        Services to stream movies to users, both are really popular and can be used on many smart devices such as smart
        TV, smart speakers, smart phones, smart watch, tablets and PCs etc.. I believe that it has affected a lot of
        people and even me on how everyone interacts with the internet by using their smart devices or computer.</p>

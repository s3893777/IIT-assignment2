            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3904117
                <br><strong>Email: </strong>s3904117@student.rmit.edu.au
            </p>
            <p>Born in Queensland, Australia, I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese on my mother's. I am
              interested in world history and events and like to study different cultures. I also have two pet cats, Anchovy and Ravioli.</p>

            <p>I have always had a passive interest in IT from a young age, as I was surrounded by it for as long as I can remember. My
              mother and father were very early adopters of computers in the ‘80s, and even now, I can still remember, as a child, my
              mother using a computer and showing me the amazing things it could do. I have always loved computers and technology, and
              when I was a teenager, I came across a video about programming on YouTube. In the video, the programmer gave a quick
              backstory on himself and how he got into IT. I immediately related to his story, and it stimulated my interest. I then
              began watching video after video on programming. Finding the magic and wonder for something new, and since then, I knew
              my future would be in IT. My IT experience is limited to self-learning videos, mostly from Youtube, with no official IT
              experience or studies as such.</p>

            <h2>Peronality Test</h2>
<p>After analysing Blade's results, he concludes he is a visual learner, is high in agreeableness, and is also introverted. This brings
  the matter forward that he has “a lot of self-doubt and always end up helping everyone else but himself.” Blade is extremely helpful
  and attentive to others needs. Blade is at his best when helping others, although the results have shined a light on a possible area
  for self-development. Resolving his self-doubt and being more confident in his own work. Blade is mostly a visual learner, meaning
  reading and seeing, touching learning style suites his needs.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
			<h3> Software Tester</h3>
            <p>Blade's ideal job is structured and formulaic as a Software Tester. Critical thinking and problem-solving are key. Blade's
              role will require thorough testing of every aspect of the software, quality control, and bug testing. Blade would assess the
              software, gather data, set up tests, troubleshoot, and report on the errors and possible solutions he finds. In some scenarios,
              he may assist in repairing the issues, so software development skills are required. Ideally, a computer science degree would
              assist in this position. Blade would program code within established testing protocols, guidelines, and quality standards to
              ensure systems perform to specification. He would also perform organisational systems architecture reviews and assessments,
              recommending current and future strategies and directions for hardware and software. Creating and reviewing technical
              documentation, such as procedural, instructional and operational manuals or guides, technical reports and specifications,
              and maintenance inventory systems would also be part of Blade's ideal job.</p>

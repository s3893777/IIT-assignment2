            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3904117

            </p>
            <p>Born in QLD Australia, I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese. I am interested in world
                history and events and like to study different cultures. I also have two pet cats, Anchovy and Ravioli.
            </p>
            <p>I have always had a passive interest in IT from a young age, as I was surrounded by it for as long as I
                can remember. My mother and father were very early adopters of computers in the ‘80s and even now I can
                still remember, as a child, my mother using a computer and showing me the amazing things it could do. I
                have always loved computers and technology and when I was a teenager, I came across a video about
                programming on YouTube. In the video the programmer gave a quick backstory on himself and how he got
                into IT. I immediately related to his story and it stimulated my interest. I then began watching video
                after video on programming. Finding the magic and wonder for something new, and since then I knew my
                future would be in IT . IT experience is limited to self learning videos mostly from youtube, no
                official IT experience or studies as such.</p>

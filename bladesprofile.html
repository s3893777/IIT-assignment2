            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3904117
                <br><strong>Email: </strong>s3904117@student.rmit.edu.au
            </p>
            <p>Born in QLD Australia, I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese. I am interested in world
                history and events and like to study different cultures. I also have two pet cats, Anchovy and Ravioli.
            </p>
            <p>I have always had a passive interest in IT from a young age, as I was surrounded by it for as long as I
                can remember. My mother and father were very early adopters of computers in the ‘80s and even now I can
                still remember, as a child, my mother using a computer and showing me the amazing things it could do. I
                have always loved computers and technology and when I was a teenager, I came across a video about
                programming on YouTube. In the video the programmer gave a quick backstory on himself and how he got
                into IT. I immediately related to his story and it stimulated my interest. I then began watching video
                after video on programming. Finding the magic and wonder for something new, and since then I knew my
                future would be in IT . IT experience is limited to self learning videos mostly from youtube, no
                official IT experience or studies as such.</p>

<p>Blade
After analyzing Blades Results, he concludes he is a visual learner, he is high in agreeableness and is also introverted.  This brings the matter forward that he has “a lot of self doubt, and always end up helping everyone else but himself.” Blade is extremely helpful and attentive to others needs. Blade is at his best when helping others, although the results have shined a light on the possible area for self-development. 
Blade is mostly a visual learner, meaning reading and seeing, touching learning style suites his needs.

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>Machine learning at its core is essentially a computer that fetches and processes data, and then makes
        decisions and predictions accordingly based on the data it has retrieved. The computer can process information
        millions of times faster than humans when it comes to viewing and collecting that data. Some of the basic
        functions that machine learning can do: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interprets internet search algorithms.</li>
        <li>Detects what type of emails are spam in your inbox.</li>
        <li>Sorts out and compiles different categories of information on data bases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More advance forms of machine learning have come to be known as Artificial Intelligence or AI, which can
        complete much more in depth tasks by following a specific program which allows the computer to learn and make
        choices without any supervision required. This is only a partial or narrow form of AI. Narrow/weak AI is only
        intelligent at performing certain tasks. This type of AI and machine learning follows a specific algorithm to
        complete its function.</p>
      <p>Computer programmers can design and create these algorithms that the computers can then process the data and
        give accurate calculations such as 'how much the steering wheel of the car needs to be pulled when making a turn
        on the road' or separating and classifying different types of animal species. To put together this algorithm,
        you would first need to need to physically collect the date in a real environment â€“ know as training data. Then
        the data can be formulated into an equation. This data would be written into a program as code which would make
        a system for the computer to process and decide upon called a decision tree.</p>
      <p>See decision tree example: </p>

    </figure>
      <p>AI's can also learn and improve over time. They can grow their understanding and evolve, doing specific tasks
        much faster than any human can. Reinforcement learning is a type of learning that an AI uses to go through the
        trials and errors of experience. It finds out what worked and what didn't work and then adjusts appropriately to
        locate the best possible outcome or solution. For example, an AI learning the games Chess or Go, is able to play
        itself millions of times to work out the best moves and strategies in order to win.</p>

      <h2>What can be done now?</h2>
      <p>With all the progress and advancements in Technology, no human level of AI has been demonstrated yet and some
        people believe its not even possible. However, the use of Narrow AI is already being used throughout businesses
        and services to successfully save time, money and overall efficiency. Many of these innovations have come from
        AI being programmed to follow a certain algorithm and apply the use of Deep Nural Net. These types of AI can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find people's faces in photos and videos</li>
        <li>Drive vehicles autonomously </li>
        <li>Translate human speech </li>
        <li>Diagnose medical conditions</li>
        <li>Create Virtual assistants</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>What's coming next? </h2>
      <p>IT has been making people's jobs obsolete throughout history. Machine learning and AI will continue to be no
        different. Within just a few years (estimated around 2024) it's likely that AI will take over duties of writing
        minor coding in the near future. It will also be able to run faster and more improved algorithms that do not
        need to be monitored and will eventually be able to write entire codes of markup and styling languages (HTML &
        CSS).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Technologies and other developments that make this possible?</h2>
      <p>The continuous upgrades to computer processors and systems year by year contributes to further improvement and
        capabilities of what machine learning and AI can do. The constant involvement from programmers and engineers
        also helps, as they come up with new and inventive ideas to continuously increase the capacity of an
        ever-growing conglomerate of information and discovery.</p>

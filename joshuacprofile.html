            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3909173

				<br><strong>Team : </strong>The A Team
            </p>
            <p>I was born in Australia and have lived here my whole life. I just turned twenty-nine;
              I enjoy keeping in shape with skiing, swimming, and dancing. I don't carry any IT experience
              other than my day to day use. However, I have always felt intrigued by IT for as long as I
              can remember. Whether it was through video games consoles or even general home appliances,
              I've been fascinated by what makes them operate and how they came to be.</p>

            <h2>Peronality Test</h2>

                <p>Josh agrees with the results of the personality tests, confirming he is self-aware of his major personality traits.
                  Josh is assertive and emotionally stable. Josh agrees he socialises well and gets along well with most. Josh isn't
                  afraid of most social situations and can handle negotiations, and works through ideas with others well. Josh is
                  aware of others and works to help them feel comfortable around him. Josh learns best through practical experience.
                  Once again, Josh has looked at the results and reflected on his personal patterns and behaviours, bringing attention
                  to his personality and potential weaknesses. This gave Josh “the necessary blueprints to further enhance [his]
                  capabilities.” Josh will be more mindful “not to force my own perspective on [others].”</p>

            <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
			<h3>  Software Development </h3>
            <p>Josh’s ideal job is a creative role in Software Development. Josh will need to analyse clients needs, identifying the core
              functionality security and performance needs and then design test and develop efficient software to meet these needs.
              Communication is a great attribute to have in order to speed up the process and eliminate errors. Josh would analyse
              the current software report on every aspect that needs improvement, suggesting and implementing improvements and upgrades.
              In a new design case scenario, Josh will analyse the client’s needs and provide a report for the client to approve the design
              and functionality. Design is a key factor for Josh, as he will need to be able to design all items of the software and align
              them accordingly. Josh will also maintain the software, ensuring reliability, security, and manage any updates. Josh will need
              to run the show, he will be in charge of the entire development process of a program. In some scenarios, he may have programmers
              that write the code and in others, he may need the skills to write the code himself. Josh will also process quality control ensuring
              the end program is, as reported to the client, ensuring nothing was missed along the way. Software developers usually have a
              bachelor’s degree, typically in computer science, software engineering, or a related field.</p>

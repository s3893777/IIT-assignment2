            <p>I was born is Australia and have lived here my whole life. I Just turned 29,
                I enjoy keeping in shape with skiing swimming and dancing. I do not carry any IT experience other than
                the day to day use of IT, I have always felt intrigue towards IT for as long as I can remember. Whether
                it was through video games consoles or even general home appliances, I've been fascinated by what makes
                them operate and how they came to be.</p>

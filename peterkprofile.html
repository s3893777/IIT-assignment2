            </p>
            <p>I was born in Australia, I have heritage ties to Greece and Lebanon. I have zero IT knowledge other than
                daily use. I’m a father of 3 beautiful children, I currently run three businesses, I have a lengthy
                working career and life experience. Most of my education has been in Business or Real Estate related.
                Hobbies, I work out and have trained Jiu Jitsu for 6 years. I first became interested in I.T. Very early
                in primary school, when our IT teacher stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects.
                Our first project was a traffic light system automatically turning on and off traffic lights in a
                certain order. His passion for IT was inspiring and stimulated my passion, I love anything electronic
                and techy. Since then, I have had a strong interest in any tech, whether in business or personal life.

            <h2>Peronality Test</h2>
            <h3>  Individual test outcomes </h3>
<p>Peter used the results to look inside his personality and behaviors, Peter looked at the results in how it would affect more of the group dynamic, how he is inclined to act in a group and potentially where he would fit best. Peter is high in Assertiveness and prospecting, meaning he is firm with his decisions and good at improvising and keeping options open. 
Peter was unaware he was so high in assertiveness, so the test has brought his attention to how he may potentially cause harm to the group by overriding a more introverted team member. </p>

            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3904716

            </p>
            <p>I was born in Australia and have heritage ties to Greece and Lebanon. I have zero IT knowledge other than daily use.
              I’m a father of three beautiful children, currently run three businesses, and have a lengthy working career and life
              experience. Most of my education has been in business or real estate related. Hobbies, I work out and have trained
              in Jiu-Jitsu for six years. I first became interested in IT very early in primary school, when our IT teacher
              stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects. Our first project was a traffic light system
              automatically turning on and off traffic lights in a certain order. His enthusiasm for IT was inspiring and
              stirred my own passion; I love anything electronic and techy. Since then, I have had a strong interest in any
              tech, whether in business or personal life.</p>

            <h2>Peronality Test</h2>
<p>Peter used the results to reflect on his personality and behaviours and looked at how his results could affect the group dynamic:
  how he is inclined to act in a group and potentially where he would fit best. Peter is high in assertiveness and prospecting,
  meaning he is firm with his decisions and good at improvising and keeping options open. Peter was unaware he was so high in assertiveness,
  so the test has brought his attention to how he may potentially cause harm to the group by overriding a more introverted team member.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
            <h3>Peter’s ideal job  Business Analyst, IT.</h3>
<p>Peter’s role is as a creative and critical thinker. Peter needs to have strong communication and understanding of business requirements,
  attention to detail, and analytical thinking. Research and assessing current processes, technologies, and systems will give Peter a thorough
  understanding of problems and challenges to overcome. Peter will create data models, process diagrams, and wireframes. Peter will also need to
   manage relations while working closely with business decision-makers and development and testing teams to offer guidance and advice on the best
   scenario solutions to fit the business needs. Peter will need the tech lingo and knowledge to liaise with developers and systems architects to
   ensure the system is correctly implemented. He will monitor solutions and continuous improvement. Peter will also need to train the client's
   staff, producing manuals and documents of functionality. Generally, a Bachelor's degree in business administration, information systems, or a
   related field is ideal, and Knowledge of the International Institute of Business Analysis would be a plus.</p>

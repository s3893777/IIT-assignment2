        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>I was born in Australia, I have heritage ties to Greece and Lebanon. I have zero IT knowledge other than
          daily use. Iâ€™m a father of 3 beautiful children, I currently run three businesses, I have a lengthy working
          career and life experience. Most of my education has been in Business or Real Estate related. Hobbies, I work
          out and have trained Jiu Jitsu for 6 years now.I first became interested in I.T. Very early in primary school,
          when our IT teacher stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects. Our first project was a
          traffic light system automatically turning on and off traffic lights in a certain order. His passion for IT
          was inspiring and stimulated my passion, I love anything electronic and techy. Since then, I have had a strong
          interest in any tech, whether in business or personal life.</p>
